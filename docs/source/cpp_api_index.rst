C++ API Documentation
=====================

The magpy C++ library powers the core functionality of the python
interface.  The library doesn't depend on the python features and is
compiled independently of the python code. The C++ API is organised
around functions in namespaces and uses classes sparingly. Use the
namespace list for browsing the code base.
